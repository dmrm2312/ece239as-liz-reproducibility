# ECE239AS-Liz-Reproducibility

This repository contains all code, scripts, notebooks, and datasets necessary to reproduce results for the final project in **ECE 239AS: Internet Measurement and Security** at UCLA.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of the project is to explore service classification and behavior of "superhosts"—IPv4 addresses that expose many open ports. This repository contains two subprojects:

1. **Bucket Model** (supervised analysis and clustering)
2. **Naive CatBoost Strategy** (multi-class supervised classification)

In addition, the `figures/` directory includes code and images used in static dataset analysis.

## Getting Started

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ All CatBoost experiments were tested on an **RTX Titan (24GB VRAM)**. Lower-memory GPUs may crash on large splits.

---

## Reproducing Results

### 1. Run the Bucket Model

```bash
cd bucket-model
```

Follow the instructions in [`bucket-model/readme.md`](./bucket-model/readme.md) to reproduce figures using unsupervised methods.

### 2. Run the Naive CatBoost Classifier

```bash
cd naive-catboost-strategy
```

Follow the instructions in [`naive-catboost-strategy/README.md`](./naive-catboost-strategy/README.md) to preprocess datasets, run Optuna sweeps, and evaluate top-k models.

### 3. Explore Dataset Visualizations

The [`figures/`](./figures/) folder contains both:

* SQL queries for figure generation
* PNG exports of those figures

These include port distributions, honeypot service counts, and visualization of metadata frequency.

---

## Regenerating from Scratch

* To regenerate the bucket model: run both `preprocessing.ipynb` and `training.ipynb` inside the `bucket-model/` directory
* To rerun a sweep: `rm -rf naive-catboost-strategy/results/*`
* To regenerate encoded datasets: run scripts in `naive-catboost-strategy/production/`

## Acknowledgments


All team members contributed reproducible pipelines, encoding standards, and labeled metadata exploration for a better understanding of superhosts in internet-scale scan datasets.

This project was completed as part of UCLA's **ECE 239AS: Internet Measurement and Security**.
